                  When applying for a Traffic Management Centre (TMC) Road Occupancy License (ROL) permit, sometimes State Transit Authority (STA) approvals are required. This is typically for works that may affect State roads or public transport routes. Traditionally, business owners have needed to check whether their project intersects with these areas to ensure all necessary approvals are secured in advance. However, the experienced team at AAA Traffic Control does all the heavy lifting.
